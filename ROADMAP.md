# ACE System Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) system, with a renewed focus on building concrete, functional, and testable components.

## Core Problem
The ACE system, as initially conceived, was overly ambitious and lacked a foundation of working code. The immediate problem is to pivot from aspirational whitepapers to practical engineering by building one useful component at a time.

## Phase 1: Multi-Tier Context Caching (DCR) - âœ… COMPLETE
This phase focused on implementing a functional multi-tier caching system for contexts, as proposed in the `DynamicContextRepository` (DCR) concept.

### Goals
- [x] To build a robust and efficient caching system with four tiers (L1-L4).
- [x] To implement automatic tiering of contexts based on usage patterns.
- [x] To write comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
- [x] To provide clear and honest documentation of the implemented system.

## Phase 2: LLM Integration
This phase focuses on connecting the ACE system to a real Large Language Model (LLM) to enable the processing of stored contexts.

### Goals
- [ ] To create a dedicated client for communicating with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI).
- [ ] To securely manage API keys using environment variables.
- [ ] To expose the LLM processing functionality via a new API endpoint.
- [ ] To write unit tests for the LLM client using mocking.
- [ ] To update all documentation to reflect the new capabilities.

### Development Plan & Checklist
- [ ] **1. Setup Environment**: Add `openai` to `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] **2. Create LLM Client**: Implement `src/ace/llm/client.py` to handle API communication.
- [ ] **3. Implement API Endpoint**: Add `POST /llm/process/{context_id}` to `src/ace/api/main.py`.
- [ ] **4. Write Unit Tests**: Create `tests/test_llm_client.py` with mock API calls.
- [ ] **5. Update Documentation**: Update `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
- [ ] **6. Pre-Commit & Submission**: Run tests, get a code review, and submit.

## Future Phases (Post-LLM Integration)
Once the LLM integration is complete and verified, the following concrete problems could be addressed:

- **Basic Prompt Injection Detection**: Implement a simple token-based detection mechanism.
- **A/B Testing Framework for Prompts**: Build a simple framework for testing the performance of different prompt variations.
