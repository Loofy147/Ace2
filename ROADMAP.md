# ACE System Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) system, with a renewed focus on building concrete, functional, and testable components.

## Core Problem
The ACE system, as initially conceived, was overly ambitious and lacked a foundation of working code. The immediate problem is to pivot from aspirational whitepapers to practical engineering by building one useful component at a time.

---

## Phase 1: Multi-Tier Context Caching (DCR) - ✅ COMPLETE
This phase focused on implementing a functional multi-tier caching system for contexts.

---

## Phase 2: LLM Integration - ✅ COMPLETE
This phase focused on connecting the ACE system to a real Large Language Model (LLM) to enable the processing of stored contexts.

---

## Phase 3: Basic Prompt Injection Detection - ✅ COMPLETE
This phase focused on implementing a functional and testable prompt injection detection mechanism.

---

## Phase 4: A/B Testing Framework for Prompts
This phase focuses on building the infrastructure for A/B testing different prompt variations.

### Goals
- [ ] To enhance the `PromptEngineeringLaboratory` to manage and serve prompt variants.
- [ ] To implement a simple in-memory tracking system for variant usage.
- [ ] To create new API endpoints for creating and monitoring A/B tests.
- [ ] To integrate A/B testing into the LLM processing endpoint.
- [ ] To write unit tests for the A/B testing framework.
- [ ] To document the new feature.

### Development Plan & Checklist
- [ ] **1. Enhance `PromptEngineeringLaboratory`**: Implement logic for managing and selecting prompt variants.
- [ ] **2. Write Unit Tests**: Create `tests/test_ab_testing.py`.
- [ ] **3. Implement API Endpoints**: Add routes for creating and viewing tests.
- [ ] **4. Integrate with LLM Endpoint**: Add `ab_test_name` parameter to the `/llm/process` endpoint.
- [ ] **5. Update Documentation**: Update `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
- [ ] **6. Pre-Commit & Submission**: Run tests, get a code review, and submit.

## Future Phases
Once the A/B testing framework is complete, the project can move towards implementing a feedback mechanism to measure the success of prompt variants.
